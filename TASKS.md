## Open

### P1 — accuracy + cache (the current direction)
The unifying move: every verb returns *the most accurate answer currently knowable*,
automatically (no flag), and repeat runs are dirt cheap. See DESIGN.md — "The
accuracy thesis" and "The analysis cache."
- **#38 · Analysis cache (`~/.pyq/`).** Content-addressed snapshot so the first verb
  pays and the rest are near-free. Store at `~/.pyq/cache/<canonical-root-hash>/`
  (global, per-repo-namespaced, room for config/logs later). Three layers sharing one
  fingerprint — **parse** (per-file `FileIndex`, content-hash keyed, only changed
  files re-parse), **graph** (ty-*derived* edges/override-map/hierarchy/`resolves_to`,
  tree-fingerprint keyed — cache the derived relations, *not* ty's Salsa DB, so the
  cheap path never starts the parser or ty), **ledger** (runtime effects/coverage/
  shapes/call-edges by FQN, tree-keyed). Validation = `stat` sweep (`size`+`mtime_ns`)
  with `blake3` only on moved files (clean repo hashes nothing). Lazy build-on-miss +
  explicit `pyq analyze` pre-warm. Lockfile + atomic temp-then-rename for fan-out
  safety. Needs serde derives on the `pyq-resolve` graph types + a binary format
  (`bincode`/`postcard`). → enables #39, #40.
  - **#38.1** fingerprint + manifest + stat/hash sweep + cache dir layout. *Done.*
    Per-file stat (`size`+`mtime_ns`) → `blake3` fingerprint, the `ParseCache`
    manifest, `~/.pyq/cache/<root-hash>/` layout (+ `PYQ_CACHE_DIR` override,
    `PYQ_NO_CACHE` bypass), atomic temp→rename writes, and the **whole-tree
    fingerprint** (a `blake3` over every file's content hash, sorted) that keys
    the graph layer — all in `pyq-cli/src/cache.rs`.
  - **#38.2** persist/load the parse layer (per-file, incremental). *Done.*
    `cache::index_tree` reuses unchanged files' `FileIndex` and re-parses only
    changed ones; drop-in for `walk::index_tree`, all parse call sites routed
    through it. Best-effort (any cache failure falls back to a full parse).
    `FileIndex` gained `Deserialize`. Tests: `pyq-cli/tests/cache.rs` (cold==warm,
    equal-size edit invalidation, add/remove).
  - **#38.3** persist/load the graph layer (serialize ty-derived facts; cheap path never instantiates ty). *Done.*
    `CallGraph` now traverses against a `CallGraphTy` trait — either live ty
    (`TyResolver`) or `ReplayTy` over a recorded `GraphRecording`. A cold run
    builds the live graph, `record()`s its full ty-query surface (a worklist
    closure over `outgoing`/`incoming` for every reachable callable offset, plus
    `supertypes` per class and `resolve`/`incoming` per occurrence), and persists
    it to `graph.bin` keyed by the tree fingerprint; a warm run replays with **no
    ty**. All graph verbs (graph/effects/tests/describe/deadcode/canonical/
    hierarchy) routed through `cache::call_graph`; `mock-targets` stays live (it's
    the only `module_member` user). Validated byte-identical cold==warm==no-cache
    across every graph verb (`tests/cache.rs`); ~50× warm speedup on the sample.
    *v1 caveat:* a cold run records the whole graph (more work than one query),
    and any source change rebuilds the whole recording — #38.5 incrementalizes.
  - **#38.4** persist/load the ledger layer; pre-warm + progress streaming.
    *Prewarm shipped as the `index` verb:* `pyq index` builds the parse + graph
    layers up front (idempotent — replays when the tree is unchanged), `pyq index
    clean` wipes this repo's cache dir. *Ledger layer started:* `cache::ledger_effects`
    runs the suite on a miss and caches observed `(owner, category)` effect pairs to
    `ledger.bin` keyed by the tree fingerprint (`PYQ_NO_SUITE` skips; a failed run
    degrades, isn't cached). *Remaining:* extend the ledger to coverage + shapes
    (one instrumented run feeding all three), have `index` pre-warm it, and stream
    progress during the cold build.
  - **#38.5** v2 incremental: re-resolve only edges touching changed FQNs; re-run only tests the coverage map ties to changed lines.
- **#39 · Per-row `confidence` in the envelope.** Structural provenance tag on every
  result — `proven`/`observed`/`confirmed`/`predicted`/`refuted`/`unverifiable` —
  replacing free-text caveats so an agent can machine-filter. *Started:* `effects`
  rows now carry `confidence` (`confirmed`/`predicted`/`observed`/`unverifiable`).
  *Remaining:* generalize across the other folded verbs; the already-exact verbs
  should carry `proven`.
- **#40 · Automatic verification — fold the dynamic verbs into the static ones.**
  *Done — all four folds.* Over-approximate verbs auto-fuse a cached ledger (suite
  run on a cache miss; `PYQ_NO_SUITE` skips; degrade, never error/hang):
  - `effect-diff`→`effects` — optional symbol (omit = project-wide), every row
    labelled `confirmed`/`predicted`/`observed`/`unverifiable` (`tests/effects_fusion.rs`).
  - `shapes`→`describe` — the definition row shows the runtime-observed return type
    (`observed_return`) beside the declared signature; `cache::ledger_shapes` caches
    it to `shapes.bin` (`tests/describe_shapes.rs`).
  - `change-coverage`→`tests --base <ref>` — `tests` takes an optional symbol + a
    `--base`; with `--base` it's the changed-line coverage oracle (`tests/change_coverage.rs`).
  - `trace`→internal — hidden (`#[command(hide = true)]`), kept for debugging the
    dynamic tier; `effects` surfaces the fused ledger instead.
  Verb count: 17 → 13 user-facing. *Caveat:* effects/describe/tests-base each run a
  *separate* suite (effects=audit hook, shapes/coverage=`sys.monitoring`); unifying
  into one instrumented run that feeds all three is the remaining #38.4 work.

### P2 — highest leverage
- **#12 · `hierarchy` verb — class tree + override map.** Subclasses / supers /
  MRO, abstract methods left unimplemented, and for a base method every override
  (and vice-versa). The high-frequency OO-refactor footgun.
- **#13b · `tests` verb — fixture graph.** The second half of #13: pytest
  fixtures (`@pytest.fixture` defs), scopes, fixture→fixture deps, and conftest
  resolution (fixtures visible to sibling/descendant test dirs). Needs new
  decorator extraction in `pyq-index`. (test↔code map shipped as #13a)

### P3 — deeper projections / differential
- **#4 · `--baseline` differential in `pyq-output`.** Capture a baseline result
  set; on re-run show added/removed ("did my edit add dead code / new effects").
  The question an iterating agent actually asks.
- **#14 · `blast` verb — symbol-level blast radius.** Transitive reverse-dep
  closure: everything that must change / be re-tested if a symbol's signature
  changes (reverse call graph + import graph + reaching tests). (now unblocked:
  `CallGraph` reverse closure + the import graph)

### P4 — resolution surface & convenience
- **#16 · resolution-surface verbs — `resolve` / re-exports / `imports-from`.**
  `resolve` a use site to its fully-qualified symbol; the re-export / `__all__`
  map (canonical import path); resolve a bare local name to its import/def.
  *Note: qualified-symbol scoping (`A.proc`) already shipped; this is the broader
  resolution surface.*
- **#17 · `decorators` verb + framework maps.** Decorator index (`@app.route`,
  `@pytest.fixture`, `@celery.task`, …), specialized into route maps
  (Flask/FastAPI/Django), ORM model maps (SQLAlchemy/Django), and registry/DI maps
  (click/celery/signals/`entry_points`).
- **#19 · `raises` verb — static exception surface.** What a function transitively
  `raise`s and where it's caught. "What can blow up if I call this." (now
  unblocked: `CallGraph` forward closure)
### P5 — polish / big & separate
- **#9 · Dynamic tier sidecar.** Bundled Python sidecar driven by the Rust CLI:
  `sys.addaudithook` (effect ledger), `sys.monitoring` (coverage + observed
  shapes), import hooks. The runtime *oracle* that confirms/refutes the
  over-approximate static verbs (`effects`/`tests`/`deadcode`) on their shared
  blind spot — dynamic dispatch. Headline payoffs: **effect-diff** and
  **change-coverage**. Settled: **pytest-first** drive (run the suite under the
  hooks; arbitrary entrypoints later), **no opt-in flag** (invoking a dynamic
  verb is consent, same as `pytest`). Phased:
  - **#9.0 · Phase 0 — de-risk spike.** *Done — GO.* Proved (a) runtime
    frame→static FQN join (`module_components(relpath)+co_qualname`, matching
    `scope_fqn`; normalize `.<locals>.` away, credit observed `X.__init__` to
    static class node `X`); (b) `sys.monitoring` coexists with coverage.py even
    on `COVERAGE_CORE=sysmon` (coverage=id1, pyq=id3; re-runs need
    `restart_events()`); (c) audit hook maps open→fs / socket.*→network with
    correct project-frame attribution, negligible overhead via first-touch
    `DISABLE`. Demonstrated the value prop: a getattr-only `greet` edge the
    static graph can't see was observed.
  - **#9.1 · Phase 1 — audit-hook effect ledger sidecar.** Standalone Python
    package: `sys.addaudithook` → pyq's effect taxonomy, attributed to the
    nearest project FQN. Pre-3.12 compatible. *Known gap:* audit covers
    fs/network/subprocess/db(sqlite)/env-writes/import; env-reads/random/clock/
    global are unaudited → flagged, deferred to the `sys.monitoring` seam.
  - **#9.2 · Phase 2 — `pyq-dynamic` crate + pytest driver.** *Done.* Crate
    embeds the sidecar (materialize-to-tempdir), runs `pytest -p
    pyq_trace.pytest_plugin` via the resolved interpreter (`--python`/
    `$PYQ_PYTHON`, default `python3`), collects the ledger, renders the standard
    envelope. All subprocess contact confined here (mirrors `ty_backed`). New
    `pyq trace [pytest args]` verb (no opt-in flag). Pytest stdout/stderr
    forwarded to pyq's stderr so `--json` stdout stays pure; sidecar + project
    root added to `PYTHONPATH` (prepend-mode flat-layout imports); pytest exit
    threaded into `query.pytest_exit` (non-zero ≠ error — failing tests still
    run code).
  - **#9.3 · Phase 3 — effect-diff.** *Done.* `pyq effect-diff [pytest args]`
    joins the project-wide static effect surface against the observed ledger on
    `(owner FQN, category)` → `confirmed` / `dynamic-only` (runtime hit an
    effect the syntactic surface can't match, e.g. a `getattr`-built callee —
    the payoff) / `static-only` (predicted, unexercised or over-approx) /
    `unverifiable` (category the audit hook can't see: env-read/random/clock/
    global). Dynamic `import` excluded (not a static category). Carries the
    ledger's caveats through. Rides `--baseline` (#4) when landed.
  - **#9.4 · Phase 4 — change-coverage (`sys.monitoring`, 3.12+).** *Done.*
    `pyq change-coverage [--base <ref>] [pytest args]`: parses `git diff
    --unified=0` for changed new-file lines (relativized to the scan root),
    runs the suite under a per-test LINE-event coverage tracker, joins → each
    changed line `covered` (+ the pytest nodeids that ran it) / `uncovered`,
    plus changed files no test reaches. The oracle behind the `tests` caveat.
    Pre-3.12 degrades to `unknown` with a warning (audit-hook effects still
    work). Coverage tracker uses tool id 2, never `DISABLE`s (needs every line),
    caches relpath on the hot path.
  - **#9.5 · Phase 5 — observed shapes (+ import hooks deferred).** *Done
    (shapes slice).* `pyq shapes [pytest args]`: records the concrete return
    type each callable produced at runtime via `PY_RETURN` (3.12+, tool id 4),
    unioned per FQN (`add -> float | int`) — runtime evidence next to ty's
    static inference, the first slice of the protocol surface (#21).
    Module-scope `<module>` returns filtered. Arg-type capture and the
    import-hook import-graph (audit `import` events already land in the effect
    ledger) deliberately left for later — return types are the high-signal half.
- **#21 · Spike: convention extraction + protocol/concurrency surfaces.**
  Convention extraction (naming, import style, error-handling/logging idioms —
  scope tightly); protocol/structural conformance (what satisfies `Protocol P`);
  concurrency surface (async/await reachability, threading, locks).

### Enhancement (symptom already fixed)
- **#36 · Honor a source root natively for ty precision.** *Shipped:* ty reads
  `[tool.pytest.ini_options] pythonpath` as extra-paths. Residual: broaden to
  `[tool.ty] extra-paths`/`src.root`, `src/`-layout auto-detect, or a `--src-root`
  flag, so bare first-party imports resolve with full ty precision (not just the
  locate-then-resolve sweep's coverage).

## Completed

### Verbs & infrastructure
- **#3 · `deadcode` verb — graph reachability.** Callables reachable from no
  entrypoint, via `CallGraph` forward reachability from a generous root set
  (tests, dunders, decorated hooks, `__all__`, module-scope refs resolved through
  ty, entrypoint files `manage.py`/`wsgi.py`/`urls.py`/`migrations/`/`management/
  commands/`, framework base subclasses `BaseCommand`/`*View`/`*Serializer`/…
  kept whole incl. methods + inner `Meta`, `[project.scripts]`). Over-approximate
  liveness, under-reports death; residual dynamic dispatch flagged (dotted-string
  config paths, callbacks-as-values, getattr, entry-point systems). New index
  fields: `Def.decorated`, `Ref.module_scope`, `FileIndex.dunder_all`. *Tuned on
  real Django repos:* first pass flagged 982 in scoring (test classes + framework
  classes + inner `Meta` as false dead) → 261 after seeding entry-class subtrees
  and expanding framework bases; alice 5.3%, mroi 1.6%. Verified it finds real
  dead code (`toggle_number`) and the residual FPs are string-config (`EXCEPTION_HANDLER`).
- **#13a · `tests` verb — test↔code map.** Which collected tests statically
  reach a symbol, as a projection of `CallGraph`'s reverse closure filtered to
  test nodes (`test_*` functions in `test_*.py`/`*_test.py`, `test_*` methods on
  a collected class: `Test*`-named **or** `*TestCase`-subclassing — unittest/
  Django/DRF, collected by inheritance). Each reaching test carries the `via`
  tree edge and `depth`. Distinguishes "exists but no static test reaches it" (0
  results) from "no such symbol" (empty roots). Framed as a *call-reachability
  lens, not a coverage metric* — for "which tests to run before this edit," not
  "what's my coverage": dynamic dispatch (attribute calls, framework routing,
  signals/Celery) is invisible, so a 0 ≠ untested (`coverage.py` is the oracle
  there), and aggregating into a percentage misleads. Both that and the over-
  approximation are flagged in the warning + README. Fixture graph deferred to
  #13b. *Found exercising it on a real Django repo:* `TestCase`-subclass test
  classes (non-`Test*` names) were missed by a name-only rule — fixed to detect
  `*TestCase` bases; root must be the package root or `pkg.sub` imports don't
  link (documented).
- **#15 · `describe` verb — symbol signature + neighborhood.** One compact
  context pack in a single envelope (the token-frugal "tell me about X"): the
  definition facet — signature (params + return annotation; bases for a class),
  decorators as written, first docstring line, def line-span — plus its
  **immediate** callers and callees (depth-1 `CallGraph` both directions) and the
  collected tests that reach it (reverse-closure test filter, reused from #13a).
  Rows tagged `role` (`definition`/`caller`/`callee`/`test`). New `Def` fields
  (`signature`/`decorators`/`doc`/`end_line`) extracted off the same parse —
  signature/decorators are whitespace-normalized source slices (ruff's
  `Parameters` range spans the parens), docstring is the body's leading string
  literal. Inherits the call graph's dynamic-dispatch blind spot (flagged);
  ambiguous names get one definition row per resolved def with a union
  neighbourhood (flagged). *Named `describe` over the spec's `card`* for
  discoverability — the `kubectl describe` mental model (attributes + relations)
  is exactly this verb's shape.
- **#20 · `canonical` verb — most-used helpers + untested public + test
  inventory.** The project-level "tell me about this codebase," three facets in
  one envelope, rows tagged `section`. **`most-used`**: internal callables
  ranked by distinct caller count, counting only callers *defined outside the
  test tree* — a new whole-project `CallGraph::caller_index` (one `outgoing_at`
  sweep per node, accumulating the reverse of each resolved call edge; recursion
  self-edges and third-party callees dropped). Floor of ≥2 non-test callers, top
  30; candidates in the test tree or an entrypoint file (`scripts/`/`manage.py`/
  migrations/management-commands, via `deadcode::is_entrypoint_file`) and dunders
  excluded — glue, not reusable utilities (entrypoint *callers* still count).
  **`untested-public`**: top-level non-`_` functions/classes outside the *tests'*
  forward closure — the same `reachable_from` + override-edge machinery as
  `deadcode`, seeded from the collected-test defs instead of entrypoints (so a
  symbol reached only polymorphically from a test still counts tested); a class
  counts tested if it or any of its methods is reached. Framework-driven symbols
  are then subtracted via a new shared `deadcode::framework_entry_fqns`
  (decorated handlers, external-base classes, entrypoint files, string-config
  targets — `__all__` deliberately kept) so the list isn't swamped by
  serializers/configs/migrations Django drives through dispatch — on real Django
  repos this cut it ~80–90% (alice 835→89, scoring 1248→233) down to the plain
  untested service/helper functions. Extracted `framework_managed_classes` +
  `is_framework_entry` so `deadcode`'s root rule and this filter share one
  definition. **`test`**: every collected test with markers parsed off its own and
  its class's decorators (`pytest.mark.*`, class-level marks inherited). Factored
  `def_anchors`/`override_edges` out of `deadcode` and a def-level
  `is_collected_test_def` into `tests_map` so both verbs share one definition of
  "reached" and "collected." Inherits the call graph's dynamic-dispatch blind
  spot, which cuts both ways here (undercounts `most-used`, over-reports
  `untested-public`) — flagged: "untested" = no *static* reaching test, not
  "uncovered" (`change-coverage` is the runtime oracle).
- **#18 · `mock-targets` verb.** Resolve every `mock.patch("a.b.c")` string
  against the project's module/symbol structure and flag *drifted* paths (the
  patch-where-looked-up gotcha — a silently-no-op patch). Built a focused
  syntactic resolver (modules + top-level bound names incl. import bindings +
  class members) rather than waiting on the full #16 resolution surface.
  High-precision: `drifted` only when the module is first-party and the name is
  provably absent; `external`/`dynamic`/`unverifiable` are reported, not flagged.
  Hardened against false positives found on real repos (Django manager/inherited
  members, builtins, nested source roots). Tier-1 third-party: when the tail
  attribute is on an imported *module*, ty follows the import into typeshed /
  site-packages and verifies it there (`time.sleep` valid, `time.slep` drift) —
  gated so it adds no false positives (moved ~60 patches unverifiable→valid
  across three repos, zero new drifts). Tier-2 (types of values, e.g. boto3
  clients) deliberately left unverifiable.
- **#11 · `effects` verb — static effect surface.** Transitive effect surface as
  a projection of `CallGraph`'s forward closure: `fs`/`network`/`subprocess`/
  `env`/`db`/`random`/`clock`/`global` per reachable callable, each attributed to
  the FQN that performs it; plus import-time effects of in-play modules. Syntactic
  call-site matching (suffix-based, alias-following) in `pyq-index`; over-approximate
  and flagged (dynamic/attribute dispatch not followed, so "pure" = "no effect found").
- **#10 · Resolved call/reference graph primitive (`graph` verb).** Transitive
  cross-file call graph keyed by stable fully-qualified node IDs (`pkg.models.User.__init__`),
  durable across edits. Forward (callees) + reverse (callers) breadth-first
  closure, `--depth` cap, cycle-safe; `query.roots` echoes the resolved FQN
  handle, each node carries `depth`/`via`. `CallGraph` in `pyq-resolve` rides the
  locate-then-resolve seam (syntactic FQN + offset, ty call hierarchy for edges).
  The foundation #11/#13/#3/#14/#15/#19 project from.
- **#1 · `inputs` verb** — env / files / CLI args / pydantic settings (DESIGN #2).
- **#2 · `imports`/`deps` verb** — import graph: forward/reverse deps + cycles (DESIGN #3).
- **#5 · CLI integration tests** over `examples/sample`.
- **#6 · Fix stale dispatch comment + add README.**
- **#7 · not-found / empty-symbol UX** — blank symbol is a usage error; dotted names resolve.
- **#8 · Column-convention parity** — verified true Unicode codepoints (confirmed working).
- **#37 · Fully hide ty/syntactic** — one locate-then-resolve API per verb; no `--syntactic`/`engine`/`source`. Includes qualified-symbol scoping (`A.proc`).
- **#24 · Unify `defs` contract** — one answer tagged `role`/`resolves_to` (subsumed by #37).

### Bugs (found exercising the release binary on real repos)
- **#22 · ty path inherits the CLI tree-walk discipline** — `--root` scoping, `.gitignore`/hidden filtering, uniform path anchoring, cwd-independence.
- **#23 · `inputs` env detection** — `setdefault`, `"K" in os.environ`, and `from os import environ`/`import os as o` aliases.
- **#25 · Structured `warnings` array + resolved root** echoed in the envelope.
- **#26 · Parse-error recovery** — walk the recovered AST so a half-edited file still answers.
- **#27 · Attribute-access call sites** — covered by the unified default (ty); the bare-`Name` syntactic blind spot no longer surfaces a silent 0.
- **#28 · `imports --cycles`** — exclude `TYPE_CHECKING`/deferred edges; ordered `a → b → a` paths.
- **#29 · `imports <module>`** — distinguish "not found" (typo) from "found, no edges".
- **#30 · multi-alias CLI option** — record the canonical `--long` form.
- **#31 · uniform envelope `query` block** — `kind`/`target` everywhere (no engine leak).
- **#32 · `refs` folds in call sites** — `callers ⊆ refs`, alias-aware.
- **#33 · same-named defs** — each result tagged `resolves_to` its def; qualified targeting via #37.
- **#34 · function-local variables** — resolved precisely by anchoring ty at the local's offset.
- **#35 · `imports` forward/reverse module identity** — canonicalize to the file-derived id so both compose on source-rooted repos.
